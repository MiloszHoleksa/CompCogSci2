Abstract:

The Predictive Processing (PP) theory posits that the human brain continually generates predictions about the environment, informed by prior beliefs, to guide behavior and perception. Bayesian modeling serves as a mathemat-
ical framework to show how these predictions are updated based on sensory input. This study investigates Bayesian modeling in the context of multi-modal perception, with a focus on the integration of audio-visual stimuli and
phenomenon known as the Ventriloquist Illusion. Utilizing publicly available data from a previous study (Kayser et al, 2020), we develop a Bayesian
model to examine individual differences in perception and susceptibility to
the Ventriloquist Illusion. Our analysis centers on the aftereffect in auditory
trials following exposure to audio-visual stimuli, modeling it as a function
of the perceptual shift towards visual stimuli. Through this investigation,
we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intersection between
Bayesian principles and PP theory in shaping human perception.
